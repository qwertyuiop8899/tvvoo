## Installation üß©

1) Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run build
PORT=7019 npm start
```

Open in Stremio: `http://localhost:7019/manifest.json`

2) Select countries (optional)

- Safe path: `http://localhost:7019/cfg-it-uk-fr/manifest.json`
- Exclusions: `http://localhost:7019/cfg-it-uk-fr-ex-de-pt/manifest.json`
- Query variant: `http://localhost:7019/manifest.json?include=it,uk&exclude=de`

3) Configure from the gear

Stremio shows the ‚ÄúConfigure‚Äù gear. It opens the `/configure` landing where you can quickly build and copy the manifest URL (with flag selection and a ‚ÄúCopy‚Äù button).

## Main routes üîó

- Manifests
	- `GET /manifest.json`
	- `GET /:cfg/manifest.json` (path style: `include=it,uk&exclude=de`)
	- `GET /cfg-:cfg/manifest.json` (safe path: `cfg-it-uk[-ex-de]`)
	- `GET /configure/:cfg/manifest.json` (compatibility)
- Catalog/Stream (also available with cfg prefixes)
	- `GET /catalog/...` ‚Ä¢ `GET /stream/...`
- Configure (landing)
	- `GET /configure`
	- `GET /:cfg/configure` ‚Ä¢ `GET /configure/:cfg` (redirect to `/configure?cfg=...`)
	- `GET /cfg-:cfg/configure`
- Diagnostics
	- `GET /health` ‚Ä¢ `GET /debug/ip` ‚Ä¢ `GET /debug/resolve?name=...&url=...` ‚Ä¢ `GET /cache/status`

## Technical notes üõ†Ô∏è

- Minimal IP forwarding; the signature (`addonSig`) is decoded/rewritten to prioritize the viewer IP
- Catalog cache on disk with daily refresh at 02:00 Europe/Rome
- Logos updated from GitHub (tv-logo) and enriched via M3U
- Useful environment variables:
	- `VAVOO_DEBUG=1` enable HTTP logs
	- `VAVOO_LOG_SIG_FULL=1` log full signature (avoid in production)
	- `VAVOO_BOOT_REFRESH=0` skip refresh at boot

## Deploy üöÄ

- Node: project is self-contained (`Procfile` present). Run `npm run build` then `npm start`.
- Docker: use the `Dockerfile` in this folder to build and publish quickly.
